Assignment: lab-polymorphism
================
Description: A lab on polymorphism for Grinnell's CSC-207. 
We created ways to modify text blocks by adding two different kinds of borders, by adding methods to horizontally and vertically compose the boxes. We also added three different equivalency methods -> equal, eqv, and eq that test equivilence by appearence, construction, and address respectively. We also added test cases to test that all of our methods work.
